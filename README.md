# HypeM.py

This is a python wrapper for the public HypeMachine API, as documented here: <https://api.hypem.com/api-docs/>

This wrapper attempts to implement all of the endpoints listed, maintaining a similar naming scheme and preserving the documentation as docstrings.

# Getting Started

I'll add some code here later...
